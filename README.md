# planets

### Install the project
First you need Node

- Clone the repo `git clone https://github.com/andreslopezlu/planets.git`
- Move into repo's folder
- Instal dependencies `npm install`
- For develop or run locally I suggest you to use live-server global, installing it with: `npm install live-server -g`

To start css and html environment, run `npm run start-dev` with this you watch scss changes

Running the server, each time you modify js files, you need to compress them with `npm build-js`

Enjoy!
